# CompilerScreensaver

A very simple and stupid screensaver, that simulates a compilation process.

Do you **love** staring at the screen while compiling Gentoo packages?
If you do, follow the instructions!

## Instructions

1. Grab some log files and copy them to the `logs` folder (e.g. from `/var/log`)
2. Install required dependencies by: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (using a virtualenv is highly recommended)
3. Launch the app by `python main.py` and enjoy!
